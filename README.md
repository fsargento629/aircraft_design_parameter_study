# Aircraft design parameter study

The current code only serves to visualize the parametric data collected about the effects of: Aspect ratio, Glide ratio, range, payload mass, take off velocity and climb angle.

## How visualize parametric plots
* Open the "param_study_partner.mlx on matlab
* Run the section associated with the parametric study you want to focus on
* Go to the MTOW section and click "run to the end"
* Et voila the plots should show up on the right
